**Notification_Manipulator:**

1) This project is intended to be a notification manipulator for Android Devices. Put simply, it aims to mute notifications the phone receives, as well as log all notifications in a saved file that could be extracted/sent at a later date via C2.
2) C2 Implentation has not been developed as it is strictly forbidden in this project.
